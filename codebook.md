"Group.1"     1
          this is the first varible taken into account while summarising.In other words this is nothing but subject_id.This column gets generated when aggregate function is performed on the data set
        
"Group.2"     1
          this is the second varible taken into account while summarising.In other words this is nothing but activity_id(in number form).This column gets generated when aggregate function is performed on the data set  

subject_id"   1
          this is the identification id for the subject on whom experiment was conducted
          
"activity_id"    character of variable length
